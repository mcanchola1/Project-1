## Problem Description:
The `al_Group_47114_G8` database is designed for managing a movie theater's operations, 
including movie showings, customer transactions, concessions, employee shifts, and loyalty programs. 
This database allows managers to gain insights into sales, customer behavior, and employee performance.

## Data Model:

Explanation of the Data Model:

Our model is based on the structure of a movie theater. The entity movies holds all of the movies that are played at our theater. It organizes many aspects of the movie like the title, genre, and duration. There are many reviews made by customers, connecting reviews to movies in a one to many relationship. The entity reviews holds the rating and description from the customer. 

Since each customer can make many reviews, there is another one to many relationship from customers to reviews. The customers entity holds each customerâ€™s name, contact information, and birth date. The customers can also choose to opt in for a loyalty program, connected by a one to many relationship since each loyalty program belongs to one customer. This holds their points balance and tier for different rewards at our theater.

The movies entity is also connected to showtimes, since each movie can be played at a different showtime. The showtimes entity connects to auditoriums in a many to many relationship since each auditorium can have many showtimes and each showtime can have a different auditorium. The middle entity is auditorium time, which identifies the specific auditorium for each specific showtime.

The tickets entity holds the seat number, price, purchase date, and multiple foreign keys. The entity is connected to showtimes to assign each showtime to a specific ticket. Tickets also connects to transactions in a one to many relationship since many tickets can be purchased in each transaction. Many concessions can also be in each transaction, connecting concessions in a one to many relationship. Concessions holds the item, price, and stock of each food item. 

Transactions are processed by an employee, connecting in a one to many relationship. The entity employees holds their name, role, and salary. Each employee can work different shifts, shown in a one to many relationship. Shifts holds the start and end time, date, and which employee works it.
